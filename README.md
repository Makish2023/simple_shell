<h1 id="description">Description</h1>

This project is a UNIx command interpreter that replicates the functionalities of the simple shell (sh) and includes additional functions. The program is entirely written in C and is created as a milestone project for the ALX Software Engineering program.

It is capable of executing commands entered by the user and displaying the output of those commands.

<p><h4>The shell is capable of:</h4></p>
<i>
<p> - Reading commands from the command line or from a script file</p>
<p> - Parsing command arguments and options</p>
<p> - Executing commands using the execve() system call</p>
<p> - Handling built-in commands such as cd, env, and exit</p>
  </i>
